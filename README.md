# MOTIONDECTECTION
# Motion Detection using OpenCV 🎥🕵️‍♂️

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **motion detection system** built using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
It captures live video from a webcam, detects movement by comparing frames, and highlights the moving objects with bounding boxes.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 Captures video in real-time from webcam.  
- 🎯 Detects motion using frame differencing and contour detection.  
- 🔲 Draws bounding rectangles around moving objects.  
- ⌨️ Press **`q`** to quit the application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `opencv-python` (cv2)  
  - `time` (for frame processing timing)
